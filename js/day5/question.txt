1. Write a JavaScript program using a for loop to print all even numbers between 1 and 20.

2. Can you create a JavaScript program that utilizes a for loop to traverse a string and count the occurrences of the letter 'a'? Include a conditional statement within the loop to only count occurrences when the letter is lowercase. 

3. Write a JavaScript program using a for loop to print the multiplication table of a given number, say 5, from 1 to 10.

4. Create a JavaScript program employing a for loop to print all numbers from 10 to 1 in descending order.

5. Write a JavaScript program that uses a for loop to calculate the factorial of a given number, say 7.
